ToDo: (In no certain order)

1) on my regular work days, I currently have a + and a -.  The plus was to add a line dedicated to night runs
This, it seems is not going to work like I had originally envisioned.  For example, if I go in to work for my regularly scheduled shift
and then go home sick before the end of my shift, I will need to have two separate entries for one day.  Therefore, my current idea is to 
take the line that was supposed to be strictly for night runs and make it a pop up window.  In this window, I will gather all the needed information,
including asking if this is regular hours, PTO hours, or night runs.  I'm thinking I can do it with a combo box.

2) FORMATTING
The whole thing needs formatted.

3) Work on the back end
I still have to work on the classes that will accept the hours, do the calculations, and then display the info.

4) Still have to add in the ability to show if a shift is a Holiday or not.

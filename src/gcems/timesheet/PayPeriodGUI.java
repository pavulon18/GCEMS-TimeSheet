    Our pay periods consist of two weeks.  They start on Thursday at 0800 and end
    at Friday at 075959.  With the way our pay period works, however, this is not a 
    set in stone issue.
    
    I am also trying to simply the impementation.  It wasn't working exactly as I had it set up
    so I am trying a different approach.
